Python codes From Practical sessions
This repository will contain all the codes from all my pratical sessions from week 1 and will be weekly updated. 
It will also contain my logbook which is a word document that has all the questions and the answers in a orderly fashioned way.
If you notice any mistakes feel free to leave a commit or open a branch where you can correct or write alternatives way to achieve the initial goal i was aiming for espacially if it is faster and more efficient.
