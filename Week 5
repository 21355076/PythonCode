Question 1: Which of the following conditions are true, if a = 13 and b = 14 ?

a)	a + 1 <= b  
b)	a + 1 >= b 
c)	a + 1 != b

a)	14 <= 14 >>> True
b)	14 >= 14 >>> True
c)	14 != 14 >>> False

Question 2:Explain the mistake(s) in the following code:

	myage = input(How old are you)
	Print(Hi there, you are +myage +old)
  
  Input:
  myage = input("How old are you")
#line 1(P != p) and line 1and3(" " missing) and  line 3 ( " + myage + ")
print("Hi there, you are  " + myage + " years old")

Output:
How old are you5
Hi there, you are  5 years old
>>> 

Question 3:Explain why the following code won’t really add the two “numbers”:

	number1 = input("Enter first number")
	number2 = input("Enter second number")
	result = number1 + number2
	print(“The result is ”+result)

Input:
number1 = input("Enter first number")
number2 = input("Enter second number")
result = int(number1) + int(number2)
print(result)

Output:
Enter first number5
Enter second number5
10
>>> 

Question 4:Write code to calculate the average of: {3, 11, 78, 112, 4, 18} in one single line of code. 
Input:
print((3+4+11+18+78+112)/6)
Output:
37.666666666666664
>>> 

Question5: Write a program that asks the user for an integer number and then prints out the remainder after the number is divided by 7.

Input:

number = int(input("Enter a number")
print( number % 7 )

Output:

Enter number56
0
>>> 
Output 2:

Enter number74
4
>>>

Question 6:Expand the above program (5.) by also printing out how often the number 7 “fits” into the number the user entered. 

Input:
number = int(input("Enter number"))
result = number % 7
print(number//7 )

Output:
Enter number99
14
>>>
