Question 1: What is the error in this statement?
	if scoreA = scoreB :  
        		print("Tie")
#the error in the statment is the character ":" that isnt seen in the program as a something that should be run.
and line 3 doesnt apply anything since the previous mistake doesnt take for account line 3.

Question 2: Supply a condition in this if statement to test if the user entered a “Y”:
	userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
	if . . . // supply statement
		print("Goodbye")    // if the user entered “Y”

userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
if userInput = Y: #then end program with a print statment.
             print("Goodbye")
             
Question 3: Find the errors in the following if statements, correct where necessary.  To be finished...

A)if x > 0 then :                           
    	print(x)
      
B) if 1 + x > x ** sqrt(2) :
     	y = y + x
     
C)if x = 1 :
    	y += 1
      
D) letterGrade = "F"
    if grade >= 90 :
	letterGrade = "A"
    if grade >= 80 :
	letterGrade = "B"
    if grade >= 70 :
	letterGrade = "C"
    if grade >= 60 :
	letterGrade = "D"
      
Question 4: Using the flow chart below, construct the if, elif, else control structure necessary to implement the flow chart. 
Complete your program to describe the earthquake by asking the user to enter a magnitude on the Richter scale 
and print out the effect that magnitude would have had (e.g. “Many buildings destroyed”).

Question 5: Write a program that sets a password as “changeme” and
asks the user to enter the password and keeps asking until the correct password is entered and then says “Accepted”. 
The program should count how many attempts the user has taken and tell them after they have been accepted. 

Extra Challenge: 
If the user takes more than 5 attempts the program should say, 
“Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password”
